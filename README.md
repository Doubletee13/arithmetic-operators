In the script file, i created two variables each that takes in a number then another variable that takes in the both veriables created initially and perform arithmetic operations on them then give out output of the result to the user.

The initial two variabless before the third foreach arithmetic operation are dynamic and can take any number from the user to perform this operations and the operators are as follows:
  
### ARITHMETIC OPERATIONS
1. Addition
2. Substraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division
5. Exponential and 
6. Floor Division
